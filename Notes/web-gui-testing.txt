Guide to test changes to the GUI / generator page code
------------
Within this repo, there is a small testing suite for website compatibility. 
After having compiled all code, for example by calling Gui.py, one can use the GUI/webTest folder to spin up a stripped down instance of the OoTR web server.
Both Python3 and NodeJS v10+ are required.

Instructions
------------

Step 1: Go to GUI/webTest/settingsParser and run node index.js
  This will generate the settingslist.json required for the GUI to function

Step 2: Drop back into GUI/webTest and run node server.js
  This will spin up a small web server on http://localhost:80/ and start your browser (if compatible)

From there, one can check their code changes as they would look like on ootrandomizer.com
